# CARL's Closet: Ecommerce Website (In Progress)

This is a web application I built from scratch using a React frontend on top of the Next.js framework and TailwindCSS for styling. It is the second website I have built (my personal website being the first) so I improved by using more modern technologies and approaching the front-end design with a mobile-friendly mindset. I am currently working to add back-end functionality to this project.
